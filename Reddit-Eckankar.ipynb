       "  'Comment': \"Good point about the potential for overwhelm. I'd encourage you to take it slowly; there's no need to rush.\\n\\nStarting with The Easy Way Discourses by enrolling as a student will give you much food for your spiritual journey, and an opportunity to 'test drive' the teachings for yourself. In the end, it's our own experiences that 'make' the path for each of us.\\n\\nThis also makes you eligible to join a Satsang class, where other students gather, either in-person or online, to discuss these monthly lessons. It's a great opportunity to hear others' experiences and insights, to contribute your own, and to benefit from the assembled insight in the room. Something special often happens in Satsang classes--again, this is best experienced for oneself.\\n\\nIf you're comfortably working with the ECK discourses and the spiritual exercises within them, there is a lot of free online content to consume as additional material: podcasts, eBooklets, and the like. You can find links to these in the pinned comment on our reddit page.\\n\\nIf you still want more, you might start with a book that's tailored to your strongest interests: Dreams? --> Try the little book, ECK Wisdom on Dreams (e-book is like 1 or 2 dollars on Amazon), or The Art of Spiritual Dreaming.\\n\\nEckankar: Key to Secret Worlds is a great book; as is Sri Harold's autobiography ( Autobiography of a Modern Prophet ).\\n\\nBut above all, I'd encourage you not to rush, and to give time to savoring the discourses, and trying the spiritual exercises therein with love and attention. You won't be disappointed.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'My father is an agnostic (though it wouldn’t be entirely inaccurate to call him an atheist), my mother is an Eckist (google Eckankar if you like most people have no idea what that is) so I wasn’t brought up in Christianity. My parents both invited me to take part in their spiritual lives, but they didn’t much mind if I didn’t. Neither of their beliefs sounded right for me, so I never did. But as I got older, I felt a need for spiritual fulfillment in my life.\\n\\nAs a young teen I dabbled in paganism and Wiccan beliefs, but I didn’t really find what I needed there. I seriously looked into Jewish conversion, feeling like it was much closer to what I was pulled towards, but it also wasn’t quite what I was seeking.\\n\\nEventually, I was reading a biography and the author was talking about his experience with the Quaker church. It sounded so lovely and much more on the right track for what I needed. I kinda couldn’t believe I didn’t think to consider Christian denominations earlier but hey, it’s the destination, not the journey.\\n\\nFrom there I attended some local Quaker meetings, found it to be in the right vein of spirituality for me, and comfortably started seeing myself as a Christian.\\n\\nA few years down the road, and I’ve not lost my faith, but know that something is still not right. Yes, my church and I believe together, but that seems to be the only link between us. We rarely talk, and only ever on a Sunday before a meeting. We don’t celebrate together, we don’t cry together, hell, we hardly worship together considering no one in the circle hardly ever spoke. Every fiber of my belief told me that the holy is meant to be shared as a community, and we were not sharing much at all. They were lovely people and I’m glad I meet them, but we needed different things. So dejected, I stopped showing up, and decided to spend time being faithful on my own and seeing where gods winds would take me.\\n\\nI ended up finding it when, of all people, my Jewish friend invited me to an event talking about Christianity and sex. It was a campus church group run by an Episcopal priest, and my god was it the funniest, most loving, spiritually fulfilling group I have ever met. They met once a week to talk about something relating to faith while they ate takeout. I was hooked. I started showing up every week, and have continued to this day. I slowly learned about and got to participate in various denominations, finding that my beliefs and how I like the honor them align best with Episcopal and Lutheran churches, and started attending an episcopal church, eventually getting baptized.\\n\\nI am now preparing to be confirmed, and I don’t think I’ve ever before felt so strongly in my heart that this is where I’m supposed to be. I hope everyone can find a place that makes them as happy as me.',\n",

It's an advanced form of an out-of-body projection that you do under your own control, whenever you want and in full consciousness.\\n\\nOnce you experience out-of-body or Soul Travel, you'll never struggle again with your mortality. Because you'll know from your own experience that you continue to exist after death of the physical body. You can visit relatives and loved ones after they've passed away and then easily return to your physical body to continue life in the physical world. You see your home in the inner worlds, where you live after death of the physical body. You can see for yourself that life goes on. You won't have to wait for your own physical death. And those who know how to travel out-of-body no longer fear death. You are also able to meet Spiritual Masters directly one on one, to gain a deeper understanding of their teachings that can't be gained by words alone from a book. Learning Soul Travel answers all the questions you asked here and more.\",\n",

As a child on a farm in southern Ohio my grandmother and I would sit on the front porch and at times, dozens of Civil War Soldiers would walk in front of our farm house again and again in broad daylight, appearing totally solid. I'd run up to the road and want to play with them as they were young, but they never responded to me. Decades later I watched a documentary on the Civil War and learned after the war there was no way for soldiers to get home except to walk. I wonder if these soldier boys survived the war but never made the trip back home. I just made a video about that.\\n\\nAfter my experience with my boys, as that was so personal, my deep emotions opened up from being closed to open to a more loving, outgoing flow of energy to reach out to others, as a nurse and as a person. Yes, my senses enhanced, I was more in tune with my patients that couldn't verbalize and I'd reposition them, or medicate or clean them as I could feel their distress. I just posted about one of my Hospice patients showing me her soul before and after her death a few days ago. Yes, the more experiences with the other side opened my awareness to more and more.\\n\\nI think the Universe is always speaking to us, always and always, but we don't often listen to it. When having a spirit experience we start paying more attention to the Universe communicating. It's like building a muscle less used to being stronger. I'm a member of Eckankar so Out of the Body Experiences is normal in that path. The Universe whispers, I think so we lean towards it to hear and get closer to it. It wants to draw us towards It, and it does so by simple, little 'coincidence' or feelings, or dreams, or moods or intuition to get our attention. The more you associate with It the more benefits you receive.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Concepts like social memory complex, mind body spirit complex, channeling and the Universal Oneness are all foundational to the Rosicrucians.\\n\\nDo the Rosicrucian materials use the specific terms \"social memory complex\" or \"mind/body/spirit complex\"?\\n\\nDo the Rosicrucian materials define these terms? Or can you (or those who have mentioned involvement, u/IRaBN u/matthias_reiss) provide example(s) of how the Rosicrucian teachings use these terms in context, so we can get an idea of what they mean by them?\\n\\nAs for connections to the Ra material, my own impression is similar to what u/matthias_reiss said: Carla and Don (and perhaps Jim, though less so) had some familiarity with the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, etc. Don aspired to be seen as the \\'white magician\\' and thus was attracted to \\'secret\\' knowledge, psychic surgery, and magic, such as the banishing ritual that they were so fond of. Carla mentions \"the Order of the Rosy Cross, Eckankar and Theosophists\" in her 1987 book A Channeling Handbook.',\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Very mundane, in a sense. I was folding clothes in my bedroom, and suddenly He was there. Like a nosy neighbor barging in. No physical presence, no visions, no auditory anything. Nothing strange or special, just “there”. I was very put out, actually, I liked my atheist life thanks. I was like, how long have you been there? I got the sense, “always”. I said, ok, but on my own terms. Like, I’ll look at “your stuff” again but no promises. I even promised to get rid of all my eastern (Asian) stuff if He was real. Again, the sense of, oh no, you’ll need all that. Over the next couple years, I went back over stuff that I’d studied in order to debunk. Not Christianity or Catholicism tho, I knew for sure they were wrong. But Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, even some weird ones like Eckankar. I started seeing what I hadn’t before. Shards of Christianity were everywhere, like a broken stained glass window. So I went back to Christianity. Got involved in my parent’s Anglican Church because it was what I knew. Thought that was where I should be. Got my siblings baptized, taught Sunday School. Eventually the sense of being pushed, got to me. I was still searching. I read a ton, and ppl like Chesterton and John Henry Newman, who studied backwards thru history to find the truth, started making sense. I eventually met a guy at a science fiction convention, who answered questions no one else I’d met could (he’s now my husband of 43 years). He invited me to Mass. At the consecration of the Eucharist, I sensed something, or rather Someone, familiar. I asked, you mean you are here?! The sense I got back was “always”. I was Catholic that moment. The 3 months it took to be accepted into the Church was the longest wait in my life. Every difficulty I had with the faith was gone. I understood it. Everything about the Church made sense, even the bad and imperfect parts or rather, people. God doesn’t “make” you perfect. He just gives you the opportunity.\\n\\nI originally entered the Catholic Church, Roman rite. I had to learn everything tho. I learned the Eastern Churches still existed, and in this country (USA) as well. My husband, himself devout, said it was like tying a rocket to his leg. With the blessing of the Roman Catholic and Ukraine Byzantine Bishops, my husband and I switched jurisdictions to the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Oddly enough, my husband had wanted to be a priest at one point, but chose marriage to me. He learned that in the East, he could have both. So he’s studying for the Diaconate now, and may yet become a priest.',\n",

They really aren’t into huge gatherings, instead they practice their spiritual exercises (types of meditation ) in small groups called sat sang and individually alone. They do charge a membership fee for this that I think is like a couple of hundred bucks a year but that was the only financial relationship my family ever had with them. I’ve been to what they call the worldwide, an exception to their dislike of large gatherings, held in Minneapolis every year. It has a great energy and you’ll see many African and Asian ethnicities represented there along with about every other one. Their chant “hu” is something that I still use to calm myself down and try to fall asleep to as well as organize my thoughts. One thing of benefit that I had gotten from it was that “there are many paths to god”\\n\\nTLDR: a kind of of plagiarized amalgamation of eastern philosophy that, at least in my experience had absolutely no cult like undertones. However I’m also not affiliated with them anymore.',\n",

       "  'Comment': \"Duuuuude I was just thinking about this a couple of weeks ago! I had a college professor who everyone took, because he was an easy A, but no one took him seriously because his courses were primarily on Mysticism in Literature (which I happened to love). I learned some fascinating stuff from him, but he was a little all over the place. Really nice guy, and a former First Lieutenant in The Marines...he was just very old, and so most people took advantage of his forgetfulness. I'll never forget the movie Flatliners, because he randomly spent like a week of classes screening the film. I couldn't believe I had never heard of it at the time, because of the star-studded cast/my ridiculously useless knowledge of pop-culture.\\n\\nUnfortunately he passed away last year. He knew more about Moby Dick than any person I have ever met and used an entire class period once or twice on guided mediations. He would snap on students ruthlessly at times, yet was still so endearing lol. I still read his book of poetry he published now and then. He was just a really great guy, and they don't make mystics like him any more. He would definitely love Yellowjackets. RIP Dr. Jack Heitner.\\n\\nI wonder if the beliefs of Eckankar have anything to do with the plot of the show.\",\n",

If I had the absolute truth I would not share it. LoL eckists are all on their own path. I have communicated with people on the other side and spirits of different types but honestly I don’t discuss it. I keep it to myself.\\n\\nNone of this matters what matters is growing closer to god-realization and self-realization. Singing Hu daily and asking the inner master for help, guidance and protection. Those are the most important aspects of Eckankar for me. I carry god’s love in my heart and fill myself with love.\\n\\nKeep singing Hu and it will change your life. It has not made my life easier but it has made it more possible to weather the storms. Sending love',\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Have you considered learning how to leave you physical body at will and in full consciousness (OBE or Soul Travel\")? This will give you the ability to explore the inner worlds of God (e.g., astral plane) without the limitations of your physical body:\\n\\n\"One way to leave the body via Soul Travel is to lie down after dinner when you are drowsy. Plan to nap for five minutes and watch the process of falling asleep. If you try the exercise with your spouse, agree to meet outside the body a few minutes later. Then watch carefully as your mate steps free of the physical body and enters the spiritual one in a burst of radiant light.\\n\\nOne always goes out of the body when he falls asleep, but it is an unconscious act. In Soul Travel, the only difference is that we are trying to get out of the body in full awareness.\\n\\nThe moment Soul leaves the body, It finds Itself in a blue-gray zone near the Physical Plane. This zone is an approach to the Astral Plane. The sensation of moving from the Physical to the Astral body is like slipping through a large iris of mild wind currents; this iris is the Spiritual Eye. Soul enters this neutral zone of blue-gray tones in Its astral form, a sheath which looks like a thousand sparkling stars.\\n\\nThe buffer zone, or corridor, between the Physical and lower Astral Planes resembles the underground silo of an enormous rocket that is perhaps two hundred feet in diameter and more than two thousand feet deep. The ceiling of this circular pocket is open and may display a brilliant canopy of white light, or you may see a night sky sprinkled with specks of twinkling stars. There may even be a pastoral scene by a river, whose waters murmur their pleasure at life.\\n\\nWhatever scene is displayed in the opening of the vast ceiling. Soul is drawn toward it at a mighty speed. Most people begin to recall their dreams only after their departure from this launching zone between the two worlds, and after their arrival at a faraway destination on the Astral Plane.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/ECK-Wisdom-Soul-Travel/dp/1570434778',\n",

       "  'Comment': \"When I was a kid, I was able to AP at will and in full consciousness. I would look forward to going to bed every night and having those AP adventures. I didn't know what it was called then and I just thought it was normal and everyone could do it.\\n\\nWhen I was about 15, I discovered that it was not normal, and because of my upbringing in a family of staunch Catholics, that AP could be considered evil and I should not be doing it anymore. I remember coming home after a meeting I attended as a member of an teenage Evangelical group. There was lots of laying on of hands, speaking in tongues and casting out of evil spirits during that meeting. When I lay my head on my pillow that evening and went to do my routine AP, once I exited my physical body, I was immediately transported to sitting before a hideous God that laughed at me, mocked me and hurled all kinds of psychic energy attacks at me. I instantly went back into my physical body and didn't try to AP for a few years after that experience.\\n\\nAfter a couple of years, I tried to get over that fear of APing and had many experiences like yourself. First I would kind of peek out of my physical body then quickly stop. Then I would get out of my body and look at it lying on the bed and quickly get back in because I still had that fear from a few years earlier. So I can identify with what you experienced.\\n\\nI tried many different methods of getting out of my body during the next few years but the fear lingered on and I didn't make much progress. Then I read about an out-of-body method that was beyond Astral Projection called Soul Travel. Soul Travel is where I lost all fear and rapidly progressed to move far beyond the AP ability I had as a kid. With Soul Travel, I felt totally protected during my out-of-body experiences so I was able to experience incredible worlds, helpful teachers and adventures that I couldn't even imagine while doing AP.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Eckankar!\\n\\nTHAT one\\'s straight-up batshit!\\n\\nOoh - Tenrikyo! That\\'s one of the Soka Gakkai\\'s historical competitors/enemies! Ikeda\\'s 3rd lecture as President of the Sokagakkai: Open an Attack on the Tenrikyo\\n\\nAnd Seicho-no-Ie, too!\\n\\nThose are both from Japan\\'s \"New Religions\":\\n\\nJapan\\'s \"New Religions\" are all identical. Including Soka Gakkai. \"Straightforward Magical Practice\".\\n\\nHmmm...\"Konko-Kyo\" - sounds Japanese.\\n\\nFrom the late 1920s groups such as Tenrikyo and Konkokyo carried on organized propagation in Hawaii and California. They were followed later by Seicho no Ie, Tensho Kōtai Jingūkyō 天照皇大神宮教，and several others. Propagation, however, was mainly confined to people of Japanese descent. Source - research paper now here\\n\\nHuh - this is interesting:\\n\\nThe breakthrough in the United States was made by NSA. The first group of Soka Gakkai members was formed in 1960. At first the mainstays were women who had married American men\\n\\nThat should read \"American servicemen\" - it was all military brides, hence the Soka Gakkai\\'s connection to the military.\\n\\nand gone to live in America, and other people of Japanese descent. As early as 1964 there were discussion meetings in English, the journal World Tribune was being published, and other early efforts were being taken to penetrate non-Japanese society. In the latter half of the 1960s a remarkable number of non-Japanese, especially white youths, joined the New Religions, even exceeding the number of Japanese who joined. NSA\\'s most surprising growth took place in the latter half of the 1960s, and the impetus continued on into the first half of the 1970s. Official adherent numbers are given as 200,000 in 1970，rising to 245,000 by 1975.\\n\\nThat was all information provided by first/longtime/former General Director George M. Williams (né Masayasu Sadanaga), not by any independent source. Still, ALL NSA\\'s development is due to Mr. Williams - there\\'s no question of tha.\\n\\nAfter that, however, NSA membership fell rapidly. The number of copies of World Tribune printed in 1975 was 60,000; this dropped to 33,000 in 1975, and down to 19,000 in 1980. The drop in membership was not to prove a long-term phenomenon, however, for in the early 1980s there was a resurgence in strength, and by 1985 the number of copies of World Tribune printed rose to 94,000.\\n\\nI know for a fact that many NSA members were carrying multiple subscriptions, though - a condition of a person getting a nohonzon was that part of the fee included 1 month of the World Tribune newspaper. If they did not then pick up and pay for the subscription after that initial month, the person who introduced them, their \"sponsor\", was expected to pay - no subscriptions were permitted to be canceled for any reason. Also, some voluntarily purchased multiple subscriptions to give out in street/door-to-door preaching (just like the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses).\\n\\nStill, the figure of 333,000 even for North American membership in 1985 does not reflect actual numbers.\\n\\nOf course not. But by ANNOUNCING such outrageously inflated numbers, Mr. Williams gained a lot of media ATTENTION for his little cult of personality. And media attention = free advertising.\\n\\nAlso, penetration into non-Japanese society to such an extent that non-Japanese made up three-fourths of the membership had already been realized in the late 1960s. According to NSAs own survey of 1970，members who identified their racial background as Asian were already no more than 30% of the total.\\n\\nPropagation in this part of the world was begun by Tenrikyo missionaries working in Korea in the 1920s. Along with colonial expansion after the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, many religious groups made inroads into colonial territories; groups such as Tenrikyo, Konkokyo, the Kokuchukai 国 柱 会 ，Gmoto，and Nihonzan-myohoji 曰本山 妙法寺 had bases established before 1925，while groups such as Hito no Michi and Seicho no Ie achieved rapid growth after 1925. Of all the groups, the inroads made by Tenrikyo were something spectacular: by 1944 they had 211 churches in Korea, 39 in Taiwan, 124 in Manchuria, and 46 in China (INOUE et al. 1990，p. 644). This expansion of New Religions along with imperialistic expansion naturally aimed not only at Japanese but also at local inhabitants. And these New Religions were also accepted by non-Japanese (mainly Koreans) within Japan, people who either moved to Japan or were sent as conscript labor. Prior to 1945, therefore, penetration of New Religions into non-Japanese society was evident in many regions of East Asia.\\n\\nNearly all of the fruits of imperialistic expansion were lost by defeat in World War II. Still, some remained, and Tenrikyo used some of its prewar propagation achievements to renew missionary activity in East Asia after the war. In fact, of all the New Religions that were active before the war, it was only Tenrikyo that had some oi its churches maintained by local inhabitants. Of the 51 churches it had in Korea as of April 1990，eight were churches that had been founded in the thirty-one years between 1912 and 1943. In Taiwan only one of its churches remained. Up to a certain point in time after the war, these churches all barely managed to survive despite violent anti-Japanese feelings, and it is easy to surmise that open propagation was not easy.

       "  'Comment': \"You aren't giving any counter arguments, and fully ignored valid points made. Do you think you are giving a good argument? Did you even look up Eckankar? Or maybe YOU have religious trauma you are projecting onto others?\\n\\nAgain, the term alien isn't mentioned in the Bible. That means any Christian can believe that cows can fly, that doesn't mean it's exclusive to the faith. Sounds straight stupid to act like every random Christian and their random ideas represent the faith.\\n\\nIf you are so informed, then how do you not know there are religious therapists? Your dialogue counters your claim of qualifications. What certificates, degrees, or honorable mentions do you have that makes you qualified?\\n\\nHow would there be a court on someone's gender, you ask. Great! You see my point. There should be no court of religion, especially by uninformed strangers.\\n\\nYou could consider therapy for yourself to understand boundaries or there is a book about it called Boundaries by Hency Cloud. You don't seem to know your place. That's a BIG issue in society so, it's understandable but you are responsible for recognizing other people's boundaries and knowing your place.\\n\\nYou can download better help on your phone and see that you can filter therapists by religion. Religious trauma is a common word you can research for yourself.\\n\\np.s. have you taken a look at the upvote/downvotes on this thread? That's decent evidence at the strength of your argument.\",\n",

The secret of getting rid of fear is to open the heart center.\\n\\nIn a heart full of love, where is there room for fear?\\n\\nLove dispels fear.\\n\\nIn contemplation, visualize the golden Light of God coming into your heart center, coming in so quietly and gently that you may not realize it's there. Imagine your heart center reacting like a pupil of an eye, opening gently to allow more Light to come in.\\n\\nThere is a way for each person to control the opening of the heart center and the flow of Light within. Inwardly, ask a Spiritual Master you trust, someone like Jesus, Paramahansa Yogananda, Ram Dass, etc., how to maintain the inner connection with the Holy Spirit to find a balance that is right for you.\\n\\nNow start singing HU (pronounced hue) either out loud or silently to yourself. HU is a love song to God and can be sung by anyone of any faith. Singing HU as a nondirected prayer can open your heart to divine love even as you sing. Truth will come to you, and fear will run away.\\n\\nKnowledge, wisdom, and understanding are only the attributes of God. But when you have love, you have the whole thing.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Sure. One translation of Eckankar is \"all-inclusiveness with God.\" It\\'s a set of teachings that allow the individual to come into harmony with the Spirit, which we call the ECK. ECK is the voice of God, which is experienced as both Light and Sound. It is in constant communication with all Souls, but of course most people haven\\'t learned to recognize the conversation. God\\'s love is never withdrawn. We learn to become aware through exercises that focus the attention and open the heart to love. A goal in Eckankar is to become a \"co-worker with God,\" which is to say to discipline the mind to no longer be reactionary and to consciously act in loving service to life. We do this through study, the spiritual exercises, and living a positive life. The true nature of a person is Soul, which is divine. Soul is profoundly aware, but the noise of an untrained mind shuts off the awareness and the inherent freedom and happiness.\\n\\nThere are many, many books on the subject. There\\'s a lot to cover. If you have more specific questions, feel welcome.',\n",

       "  'Comment': 'I think the question of fate vs free will is best understood through karma and reincarnation. The fate we experience is the consequence of our past actions — it all comes back to us. And we have no choice but to reap what we have sown. However, the causes of these consequences were created by acts of free will.\\n\\nThe reason why so many get trapped by karma is that the effect can come long after the cause, so that the person doesn’t connect the two in their awareness. This leads them to create even more karma. For example, if the effect comes three months after the cause, the cause has often been forgotten. And of course, the cause could even be from a past life.\\n\\nIf we look at our lives today, we are living a mixture of fate and free will. For some, it might be mostly fate because of a heavy load of karma. For others, it may involve more freedom. The idea is to choose wisely with our free will. The whole point of this is that our lifetimes on Earth are a learning experience that perfects us spiritually. For more on this see Karma and Reincarnation - Solving the Mystery.',\n",

Yes, lower Astral is full of beings that want a following. Interesting to look at but don't get trapped thinking the Astral is the ultimate. We focus on the Sound and the Light, mostly the Sound or Shabda. It's all here for our growth. Our experiences help us to become who we are.

In 200 to 230 the women were expelled from leadership in the church and removed from most documents. That is simply historical fact.\\n\\nHundreds of documents were available to form the Bible, and those that were cherry picked were possibly edited during their acceptance phase. None of the original documents have survived. So there is no proof that the interpretations that we have today are anywhere close to the original.\\n\\nChristianity like every religion, unfortunately, has been adapted to control the populace.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean Christianity doesn\\'t have good things in it. But so does Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and other philosophies offered by various individuals or groups.\\n\\nChristianity has \"Love Thy Neighbor; do unto others as you would have them do unto you; and for some - promises hope and helps relieve fear of death. The early Aramaic version of The Lord\\'s Prayer is absolutely beautiful and worth reading and is different to the English version. And Christianity has other beautiful things.\\n\\nBut Christianity also has some terrible things in it. And it has been used to do Terrible Things like discriminate against minorities, gays, and independent thinking, individuals.\\n\\nChristianity is responsible for the Crusades, torture, wars, genocide, justification for enslaving people, etc..\\n\\nI\\'m a Spiritual Mystic and I have studied Christianity and other religions. I know Christianity best because I was raised in a christian-centric home, but I am a pluralist believing all religions have good and bad things.\\n\\nDon\\'t let anyone of any religion try to tell you how to live. For Christians, if they do, then their hypocrites.\\n\\nTrust yourself. And if you want to follow a spiritual life, read all religions. I\\'m personally extremely fond of Sufi poetry. But that doesn\\'t mean you need to start there, and they\\'re rather riddle like - if you don\\'t already know what they\\'re talking about.\\n\\nThere are also other groups that are very positive, such as Eckankar - which some people will say is a cult; but so is Christianity with its 78 different flavors.\\n\\nUnitarian Universalist Church\\'s are very accepting of people of every race, sexual orientation, religious directions.\\n\\nBe yourself.

       "  'Comment': 'Those are good questions. One thing to consider is that a person’s karma is intertwined with the karma of the surrounding people. So, everyone in that group is performing in a karmic play — the play of destiny. Everyone has a role to play. Maybe somebody has the power and the others don’t, maybe somebody is the parent and the others the children, etc…. All will be learning and balancing their karma by playing their respective roles.\\n\\nDuring the performances, the actors do have the ability to go off script. This is the exercise of free will. And acts of free will in turn create more karma, good or bad, which will set up a new script and destiny for future lives.\\n\\nGenerally, the more spiritually aware the Soul, the more their karma is speeded up, meaning the consequences of their actions happen more quickly. So life appears to make more sense in this situation. But eventually, whether in this lifetime or a future lifetime, everything gets balanced out. Nonetheless, a big benefit comes from becoming more aware as we can consciously choose our actions and therefore choose our consequences.\\n\\nThere is also a higher aspect to karma than just retribution. Ultimately, the long experience of karma and reincarnation teaches Soul to give and receive love, because this is what’s most natural for Soul. Here is a little write-up on karma if you’re interested: Karma and Reincarnation - Solving the Mystery.',\n",

       "  'Comment': 'That\\'s about the worst advice I\\'ve ever seen anyone give on spirituality.\\n\\nPsychedelics, shrooms, etc., are all designed to keep us trapped in the world of low vibration.\\n\\nEven in moderation, they are an enticing trap designed to keep us from achieving any higher state of consciousness at all. They punch holes in our aura, allowing negative currents in, which pushes us even further away from spirituality. The way the trap works is that they are really great at making us believe that we\\'ve reached some kind of spirituality while in fact we\\'ve gone no further than the low vibrations of the lower astral plane.\\n\\nThe way we can truly know higher states of awareness is to have first-hand experiences of Soul outside the physical body the natural way proven by Saints and Mystics throughout history. We can have these natural experiences by learning out-of-body travel or Soul Travel, at will and in full consciousness.\\n\\nFortunately for us, there are many people throughout history and in the world today that have mastered natural techniques to consciously leave their physical body at will and are waiting to help us explore the inner worlds of high vibration (when they see us making the effort without using false shortcuts like drugs). Being able to consciously leave the physical body and will and explore these inner worlds is a latent ability in each and every person. These inner worlds are just as solid and real as the physical world but occur at a much higher vibration and energy. Developing self-discipline by putting in the hard work over time is what leads to spiritual awakening not trying to take an easy shortcut with mind altering drugs.\\n\\nTypically we try to justify the use of these substances by telling ourselves that they heal, free us from past traumas and even facilitate communication with God. But I\\'ve found that nothing could be further from the truth. That\\'s not healing. And it\\'s certainly not anywhere near the \"roots\" of spirituality. It\\'s only a harmful habit that carries on to our next lifetime and feeds even more karma.\\n\\nWhen you look at the history of ancient cultures, they used all kinds of natural plants to communicate with their gods. From mushrooms and cohoba to morning glories and peyote. All used by both shamans and natives to reach ritual intoxication to overcome their fears in order to have spiritual experiences. The problem is that they developed harmful addictions that feed karma from lifetime after lifetime. Little wonder that incarnating into the current lifetime, these addictions continue while we again try to justify it as healthy spirituality.\\n\\nIt is a severe violation of spiritual law to convince someone to use psychedelics for spiritual experiences. When you convince someone to try those drugs, you personally become responsible for that karma and must walk with that individual for however many lives it takes until that person is freed from the bondage of this drug experience. It\\'s a long term debt.\\n\\nSooner or later we all have to accept that there is no shortcut to spiritual awakening and that\\'s what many of those who use these substances and other drugs assume they\\'re doing. That poor assumption only shows how much these substances also destroy our good judgment.',\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Just to be clear, the Abrahamic perception of God is literally the same as Satan, meaning that it is the lower plane non-god that is the dual \"god.\" This is evident in all 3 Abrahamic religions.\\n\\nGod in Eckankar is not that lower plane non-god, but is instead the actual Godhead whom we call Sugmad. Sugmad\\'s 1st manifestation is Sat Nam on the Soul Plane, also non-dual. For these reasons I am unsure how you mean that dropping or stopping belief ion the Abrahamic God is a thing that would cause you any trouble among the ECK community, because they ought to know better than that.\\n\\nNow, the term God is a mental creation, created by the minds of humans, although the literal etymology of the word originates in the Persian hu, (and the Abrahamic religions all originate out of Zoroastrianism which is the source of monotheism and the God v. Satan opposition) the point being that it is completely normal that you drop the usage of words as such. I see this as merely your spiritual development going into another stage that is perfectly acceptable within Eckankar, although you may personally feel a need to drop it and move elsewhere, which also is fine. That is a personal choice and one you\\'ve every right to determine for yourself and i wish you luck in deciding what exactly you\\'d like to do.\\n\\nNow, as for the religion of Eckankar, and speaking generally and including both the various human understandings of such, as well as using my own spiritual experience as a whole, the physical religion is just one small component, but the inner path is the truest and most real aspect, although it is undeniable that a balance of both is required but not so easily achieved. That is the tricky part as to how you might best advance in a way that suits you and doesn\\'t make you feel limited or trapped as religions tend to do.\\n\\nI\\'ve gone and ranted endlessly and written half a chapter of a book (or so it seems to me) so i won\\'t drag this out any longer (I talk too much as you can tell) but I wish you luck at discerning your next step, and should you care to talk any of it over, feel free to do so here. I hardly know everything, but I\\'ve been an ECKist for almost 36 years, so I have dealt with a few things regarding Eckankar and if I can provide you any sort of help I\\'d be happy to, and if not then I wish you the best in finding the solution you seek.',\n",

Why aren't you accusing Christians of believing in aliens? Have you even heard of Eckankar? It's a Nazi religion founded on the same 'spiritual' ideals as Nazism. Eckankar people have pictures of Arayna (pale white, blonde hair, blue eyes) people who look like the Nazi pictures of the 'aliens' they spoke about.\\n\\nFeel free to explain why you think you are qualified to both judge and attempt to hold others accountable for the most private, personal aspect of their life when you don't know 10% of their story?\\n\\nThe reason there is no court of faith is because it's just as personal as something like gender. Why isn't there a court for gender where other people decide your gender? You are willfully disregarding the personal and intimate aspect of this subject and seem to not understand boundaries.

We can have these natural experiences by learning out-of-body travel or Soul Travel, at will and in full consciousness.\\n\\nFortunately for us, there are many people throughout history and in the world today that have mastered natural techniques to consciously leave their physical body at will and are waiting to help us explore the inner worlds of high vibration (when they see us making the effort without using false shortcuts like drugs). Being able to consciously leave the physical body and will and explore these inner worlds is a latent ability in each and every person. These inner worlds are just as solid and real as the physical world but occur at a much higher vibration and energy. Developing self-discipline by putting in the hard work over time is what leads to spiritual awakening not trying to take an easy shortcut with mind altering drugs.\\n\\nTypically we try to justify the use of these substances by telling ourselves that they heal, free us from past traumas and even facilitate communication with God. But I\\'ve found that nothing could be further from the truth. That\\'s not healing. And it\\'s certainly not anywhere near the \"roots\" of spirituality. It\\'s only a harmful habit that carries on to our next lifetime and feeds even more karma.\\n\\nWhen you look at the history of ancient cultures, they used all kinds of natural plants to communicate with their gods. From mushrooms and cohoba to morning glories and peyote. All used by both shamans and natives to reach ritual intoxication to overcome their fears in order to have spiritual experiences. The problem is that they developed harmful addictions that feed karma from lifetime after lifetime. Little wonder that incarnating into the current lifetime, these addictions continue while we again try to justify it as healthy spirituality.\\n\\nIt is a severe violation of spiritual law to convince someone to use psychedelics for spiritual experiences. When you convince someone to try those drugs, you personally become responsible for that karma and must walk with that individual for however many lives it takes until that person is freed from the bondage of this drug experience. It\\'s a long term debt.\\n\\nSooner or later we all have to accept that there is no shortcut to spiritual awakening and that\\'s what many of those who use these substances and other drugs assume they\\'re doing. That poor assumption only shows how much these substances also destroy our good judgment.',\n",

I’m not sure if Michael Newton talks directly about karma in his books, but there are probably indirect references to it. Karma is the law of cause and effect that dictates that everything we do comes back to us, i.e. you reap what you sow. All Souls are playing out their karma and this karma involves other Souls. So, we are all paying off our karmic debts to each other. This is what creates the destiny and drama of life. And because we don’t have time to balance all our karma in one lifetime, we have to return, or reincarnate, to continue paying it off.\\nHere is a little introduction to karma: Karma and Reincarnation - Solving the Mystery.',\n",

Hippies, Eastern medical practices, Zen/Taoism, the Manson Family, Branch Davidians, ESP, astrology, New Age, Eckankar, Hare Krishnas, the Moonies, Kabbalah, Satanism, crystal healing and general homegrown wacko desert commune nonsense — there was a whole American mixing pot of fringe/cult/esoteric religious beliefs with some science and, of course, enormous amounts of drugs.\\n\\nThere was more interest in the stranger, more obscure aspects of religion when Herbert was writing.

And say that dharmic religions need to change less because they're younger and have less rules?\\n\\nObviously dharmic religions aren't that young, ya Eckankar is, but Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism are all older than Christianity and Islam, and their practice actually have been shown to help with physical and mental well being, sooo what's intangible about that?\\n\\nAnd we haven't even touched on Shinto or shamanism.

Also, I don't believe you have to join any group to learn about astral projection, it's a personal journey. There are many books with esoteric knowledge and astral projection with the most simplified that I found being those by Samael Aun Weor. Esoteric knowledge that could help you understand some universal principles: Initiates Of the Flame by Manly P Hall. Start there. If you are open minded, Eckankar as well and practicing Kriya or Hatha yoga (although I recommend Kriya mostly). Again, you don't have to join any groups, gather your knowledge and use it for your own spiritual progress. Joining groups has a way of conditioning your mind to where you can't make independent judgments, you always have expectations set for you. That can be a huge hindrance.\\n\\nWish you well ❣️\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'I am a new chela (student) of Eck and am an agnostic. It’s not necessary for you to believe in a god in order to become a chela and learn more. So far after three months of studying The Easy Way Discourses and practicing the Spiritual Practices, I have yet to experience the Light and Sound of god or anything that I would identify as Soul Travel, but my dreams have become more vivid and easier for me to remember upon waking so I can recall what I dreamed. I’ve yet to identify the Mahanta in any of my dreams but have seen the Eck Master Kata Daki in the background of at least one dream. Others, by this point, have already experienced the Light and Sound of god. I think it is probably because of my lack of belief in a god of any sort that I have not yet had the experience. Perhaps because I am not yet ready.\\n\\nMy point is, everyone’s journey is different. Not everyone has the same experience at the same point in their journey, but the separate journeys are all valid. If you have come this far as to inquire here in this subreddit about Eckankar, then you are ready to take the next step in your journey. For me that was joining Eckankar so I could study directly from the church’s materials and discourses. For you, that may be attending a public Eckankar event in NYC. There are scores of books published by Eckankar that can be purchased directly from them or on sites like Amazon or Barnes and Noble; some for as little as three dollars each. If you don’t have the money or don’t want spend anything right now, you can also request various free books from Eckankar by going to their website Eckankar.org. You can also find an Eck Center near you on the website where you can attend certain non-chela events. My Eck Center here in Nashville has a lending library and even some books that can be kept by the seeker.\\n\\nWhatever you do, please take the next step, whatever that means for you. Even if you don’t eventually choose to become an Eckist, the journey of self-discovery will be well worth your time and energy.',\n",

You have found a way to bring the divine blessings into your life!\\n\\nYour question about why pray vs accepting God’s will is important. Firstly, praying to express our gratitude and love is one of the greatest things we can ever do. Gratitude opens us up to so many blessings. I find this is described nicely in The Power of Gratitude.\\n\\nSecondly, in regards to praying to have wishes granted, my approach is to always make sure my wishes are in alignment with God’s will, i.e. Thy Will, Not Mine. When I do this , I find that I can pray for things and often I receive them. But regardless of the outcome, I am always grateful. Done this way, I think it is okay to pray for the things we need. In life, we need to provide for ourselves and our families and it’s fine to ask for Divine help in doing these things if we need it.\\nUltimately, life is about giving and receiving love. We do this with God and with all living beings around us.',\n",

I was starting my spiritual journey and had been taught about our three selves (Conscious, Basic/Lower (subconscious/inner child), and High Self), so I literally just said a prayer and asked for a meeting with his High Self and fell asleep. Bingo, 3 a.m., I popped awake with glorious energies spiraling through my solar plexus and joy washing over me. I wasn't permitted to remember the event, but I got to feel the effects.

I\\'ve talked about my reasoning or rather excuses in the post but I\\'ll quote my book that had the rest of the details on the topic so that you get a full sense of all of my excuses :D The short answer would be that I just the gradual path that I am following which has given me a lot of success.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had hundreds of lucid dreaming experiences but not a lot of astral projection experiences yet. When I astral project, I notice that the astral projection experience quickly brings about many distractions to successfully lower my lucidity and turn the experience into a lucid dreaming experience and turn that one into a dreaming experience and eventually turn that into a deep sleep experience. This is why I still have a lot to do on my end to level up my spiritual powers.\\n\\nSo I have to be also honest and say that I haven\\'t actually reached the so-called god-mode state that I talked about myself even though I know such a higher state exists due to having heard it from some people on Reddit or Facebook astral projection groups, as well as people who are in the Eckankar cult where they call it \"soul travel\", some of the people who had the void like experience in near-death experiences and I also heard about it from my trusted friend Conscious Soul as mentioned before.\\n\\n....\\n\\nI am also just having too much fun in my lucid dreams that I often don\\'t even think about turning them into out-of-body experiences on my end but these days, my intention on this is changing and I am getting ready to start to try to have more astral projections experiences so that I can eventually practice experiencing the higher states. I also still need to experience the super-lucid state in my dreams more because I haven\\'t properly reached that state yet as well. At the end of the day though, I believe that the things in the dream simulations are part of the distractions so I gotta stop being the \"do as I say but not as I do\" guy and start to follow my own advice.\\n\\nAt the same time, the gradual step that I am following is often recommended by expert astral projectors as well since there are many levels to not only remembering dreams but then achieving all of the levels of lucid dreaming and remembering your experiences and then there are many levels of achieving astral projections and remembering them.\\n\\nSo, my next personal mission is to try to get to the super-lucid state more often and prolong that state while also eventually turning my dreams into OBE experiences and diving deep into the highest states possible instead of going back to the lower states of lucid dreaming. So far, I found that my gradual approach with set targets has been paying off well but it\\'s about time that I need to stop flying around exploring the dream simulations and stop \"hanging out\" with dream models and take my own advice of not getting lost in the sauce of dreaming distractions in order to advance into higher states but of course, it\\'s easier to say this than do it.\\n\\nAfter all, the matrix is an expert at throwing people off their games, as well as implementing the fear-mongering \\'what if\\' questions into our psyche but we can\\'t blame ourselves for that since we all got flaws and we are dealing with the worst kind of system that got a lot of the cards stacked against us while being here in a mind wiped state. However, I also think that the more spiritual powers we remember and taste, the more we\\'ll want to experience those states and the more \\'what if\\' questions we will eliminate.\"',\n",

       "  'Comment': \"The contrast between the physical world and the Higher Worlds is very great. This leads some to want to forsake this world and devote their time to re-entering that inner state. That's the hermit impulse, and you're right: from an Eckankar view, it is out of balance.\\n\\nWhen we return to the body we are presented with the need to operate within its constraints, which includes how our individual brains operate.\\n\\nI once had a dream where I saw a massive Snowy Owl, and it was soaring freely. It was glorious to behold such grace and power. Then it wheeled around, came down towards the ground, and somehow, impossibly, fitted itself into the tiny opening of a little birdhouse with an entrance just large enough for a sparrow.\\n\\nI've taken that to be a demonstration of the relationship between Soul and the human consciousness: we're limitless and free, but we willingly partake of the limitations of the human state.\\n\\nThrough the experience of such limitation, and through the need to operate within a world of duality, we come to learn the spiritual laws and to refine our state of consciousness.\\n\\nHow that higher consciousness of Soul manifests/becomes accessible within our waking human state is different for everyone. Some people I know can hear the Inner Master quite clearly as an almost spoken voice; others have an awareness of a wide openness and stillness behind the waterfall of their thoughts and sensations; for others, it's the spontaneous up-swelling of love in the Heart; ...\\n\\nThe spiritual exercises help each person to discover how they can recognize the presence of Divine Spirit within their consciousness. This will keep changing, probably in unsayable ways, as one goes deeper into the spiritual worlds.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'Yes, it’s an interesting question. The textbook comparison of “one god vs many gods” is probably a bit simplistic once we take a closer look. And your statement of “they’re all divisions or aspects or interpretations of a single divine unity that we could call God” is quite valid.\\n\\nMost religions describe creation as having many heavens or planes of existence. This is the case in Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Sikhism, Eckankar, and even Christianity has references to the “third heaven.” Many religions describe each of these planes as having its own god or ruler, but typically they fall under the single Creator.\\n\\nAlso, sometimes gods are personifications of spiritual forces. For example, Hinduism has the trinity of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer.\\n\\nSo there is a wide range of possibilities. There can be different images or interpretations of the same god, there can be different levels of gods under a hierarchy. And ultimately most religions describe God as being indescribable. It may be pointless, but it’s still fun to try…',\n",
