Barça are in despair, financially they can do fuck all at the moment. Real Madrid can handle losing Benzema because we can sign Bellingham for 120 million - Barça can't. The midfield isn't even comparable. Real Madrid is very lucky to have struck a perfect balance of old & young there.\\n\\nAnd it's funny, how even with all of this, Real Madrid has gone longer without winning one of the major two trophies than Barça at the moment. In spite of this, Carlo has been renewed and our confidence is sky high, and yet Xavi could be on the outs?\\n\\nBarça fans need to face reality honestly. In some games Xavi shows that he is still young as a manager, but come on... you won the league and the supercup last season, you're back in the CL KO's... as long as the club doesn't reach a stable financial situation in which it can rival Real Madrid there are going to be seasons where you'll fight for the title and others where you have to take a 3rd or 4th place.\",\n",

       "  'Comment': 'That’s the thing, Casemiro was signed by Real Madrid for £5m, he then won 4 champions league or whatever it was and then they still sold him for £60m.\\n\\nFor some reason we just can’t do that. We don’t have the capacity to sign players cheaply and have them turn into world class players. Players we even sign for potential always regress.\\n\\nWhenever I see people on our sub trying to pinpoint the one thing that is leading to our downfall, it’s all redundant because it’s every single part of this club that is failing. Players, tactics, transfers, scouting, facilities, board and owners are all not right at all. The whole club needs a ‘reset’ but I don’t even know what that looks like and it’ll always get worse before it gets any better.',\n",

If there is one thing that I really regret doing, maybe the only thing that I regret this much and something that I would like to go back in time to change, was the time I played against Di Maria. When I arrived in Atletico, we were going to play against Real Madrid, we had Aguero, Forlan, etc. Aguero told me: Felipe, if you give him a hard challenge he gets lost, he disconnects mentally. So give him a hard tackle very early on and talk about his wife. So in the game, I went after him, gave him a hard challenge, and cursed at him that \"his wife etc etc\" and threw shit at him and mentioned her by the name. Dude, then he looked at me crestfallen, and in that game, I marked him well, went hard on him quite a few other times and he really didn\\'t play well. But then I got home, man, and I regretted it so fucking badly, so, Di Maria, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m really sorry that I did that. I apologize.\"',\n",
